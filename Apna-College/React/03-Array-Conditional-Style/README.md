# Set up Local Environment for React

-- In Console

    - npm create vite@latest
    - give a project name = first-component
    - select framework = React
    - select varient = JavaScript

- Now, you can see that, there is a "first-component" folder is created. Inside, there are folders and files.
- We have to install node_modules

-- In Console

    - cd first-component
    - npm install
    - To start the server = npm run dev; it will give a link

- This is something we can call a boilerplate for starting a react app.
